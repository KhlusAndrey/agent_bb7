a high volume of negative comments on social media platforms.\n\n#### Step 1: Define Scope and Keywords\n- **Identify Key Topics**: Determine the specific areas
of interest related to the negative comments (e.g., product issues, customer service, social issues, etc.).\n- **Keyword Development**: Create a list of 
keywords and phrases that are commonly associated with negative sentiments (e.g., "disappointed," "frustrated," "hate," "bad experience").\n\n#### Step 2: Data 
Collection\n1. **Social Media Data Extraction**:\n   - Use the `tavily_search_results_json` tool to gather social media comments and posts that contain the 
identified keywords.\n   - Focus on platforms where the brand or topic is most discussed (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).\n\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n  
- Utilize sentiment analysis tools to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. This will help in filtering out the negative comments for further 
analysis.\n\n3. **Contextual Data Gathering**:\n   - Use the `get_fake_relevant_documents_chromadb` tool to gather contextual documents that may provide 
insights into the reasons behind negative sentiments (e.g., news articles, blog posts, reviews).\n\n4. **SQL Query for Structured Data**:\n   - If applicable, 
use the `get_fake_sql_query_result` tool to extract structured data from databases that may contain user feedback, ratings, or comments related to specific 
products or services.\n\n#### Step 3: Data Analysis\n1. **Thematic Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the negative comments to identify common themes or topics. This can
be done through qualitative coding or using text analysis software.\n   - Group comments into categories based on the identified themes (e.g., product quality, 
customer service, pricing).\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Calculate the frequency of each theme to determine which issues are most prevalent in the 
negative comments.\n   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) to represent the data clearly.\n\n3. **Trend Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the 
timeline of negative comments to identify any spikes or trends. This can help correlate negative sentiments with specific events or announcements.\n\n#### Step 
4: Insights and Recommendations\n- **Summarize Findings**: Compile the key issues identified from the analysis and summarize the reasons behind the negative 
comments.\n- **Actionable Recommendations**: Based on the findings, provide recommendations for addressing the issues causing negative sentiments. This could 
include improving customer service, product quality, or communication strategies.\n\n#### Step 5: Reporting\n- **Create a Comprehensive Report**: Document the 
research process, findings, and recommendations in a clear and concise report.\n- **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to share insights with stakeholders, 
highlighting the key issues and suggested actions.\n\n#### Step 6: Follow-Up\n- **Monitor Changes**: After implementing recommendations, continue to monitor 
social media comments to assess if there is a reduction in negative sentiments.\n- **Iterate**: Adjust strategies based on ongoing feedback and new data 
collected.\n\nBy following this research plan, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to negative comments and develop strategies to 
mitigate them effectively.',

negative comments on your social media page, it’s important to consider whether you want to respond or not depending on the circumstances. Things You Don’t Want
on Your Page\nAnother situation in which you will not want to engage or respond is if the commenter is putting things on your social media page that you don’t 
want to be there. If you decide that you do want to respond, then you’ll need to choose whether to be serious or funny, and whether to respond in public or take
it into a private conversation.\n"

    'plan': '### Research Plan: Understanding the Sources of Negative Comments\n\n#### Objective:\nTo identify the key issues or topics that are causing a high 
volume of negative comments on social media platforms.\n\n#### Step 1: Define Scope and Keywords\n- **Identify Key Topics**: Determine the specific areas of 
interest related to the negative comments (e.g., product issues, customer service, social issues, etc.).\n- **Keyword Development**: Create a list of keywords 
and phrases that are commonly associated with negative sentiments (e.g., "disappointed," "frustrated," "hate," "bad experience").\n\n#### Step 2: Data 
Collection\n1. **Social Media Data Extraction**:\n   - Use the `tavily_search_results_json` tool to gather social media comments and posts that contain the 
identified keywords.\n   - Focus on platforms where the brand or topic is most discussed (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).\n\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n  
- Utilize sentiment analysis tools to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. This will help in filtering out the negative comments for further 
analysis.\n\n3. **Contextual Data Gathering**:\n   - Use the `get_fake_relevant_documents_chromadb` tool to gather contextual documents that may provide 
insights into the reasons behind negative sentiments (e.g., news articles, blog posts, reviews).\n\n4. **SQL Query for Structured Data**:\n   - If applicable, 
use the `get_fake_sql_query_result` tool to extract structured data from databases that may contain user feedback, ratings, or comments related to specific 
products or services.\n\n#### Step 3: Data Analysis\n1. **Thematic Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the negative comments to identify common themes or topics. This can
be done through qualitative coding or using text analysis software.\n   - Group comments into categories based on the identified themes (e.g., product quality, 
customer service, pricing).\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Calculate the frequency of each theme to determine which issues are most prevalent in the 
negative comments.\n   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) to represent the data clearly.\n\n3. **Trend Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the 
timeline of negative comments to identify any spikes or trends. This can help correlate negative sentiments with specific events or announcements.\n\n#### Step 
4: Insights and Recommendations\n- **Summarize Findings**: Compile the key issues identified from the analysis and summarize the reasons behind the negative 
comments.\n- **Actionable Recommendations**: Based on the findings, provide recommendations for addressing the issues causing negative sentiments. This could 
include improving customer service, product quality, or communication strategies.\n\n#### Step 5: Reporting\n- **Create a Comprehensive Report**: Document the 
research process, findings, and recommendations in a clear and concise report.\n- **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to share insights with stakeholders, 
highlighting the key issues and suggested actions.\n\n#### Step 6: Follow-Up\n- **Monitor Changes**: After implementing recommendations, continue to monitor 
social media comments to assess if there is a reduction in negative sentiments.\n- **Iterate**: Adjust strategies based on ongoing feedback and new data 
collected.\n\nBy following this research plan, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to negative comments and develop strategies to 
mitigate them effectively.',
